This repository will host the files necessary to build and run a website created by Sig.

There are a couple of reasons I want to make this website:
 - A place to exist. (As of late, I have had no place to just directly insert my content.)
 - Develop the simplest possible product to get the job done. (I considered using fancy technologies like React and Bootstrap CSS and it's all just bloat and unncessary. I want people to load my site in the few kb they need to see to work with it. Not hundreds and hundreds of extraneous unnecessary bits.)
 - Share Code. I need the ability to share what I do coding-wise and to allow others to type up code to run as well for practicing.
 - Project Management. Able to internally hold all my project data and show off what I work on. I'm not content with just "oh, here's yet another project on github." I want more metadata tied to it and a clean, concise way for others to go looking at it.
 - Interactivity. I want people to be able to talk to me and reach out to me if they have a sudden urge or need, or just a random question that I could answer. It needs to be simple, fast, and available (Mobile notifications? https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/push-notifications/).
 - Sells myself. There should be ways for people to hire me for coding projects.

Potential domain names:
